    "description": "The ASMXAUX_1B Product contains detailed information on the S/C magnetic stray fields at the ASM sensor position. The data are provided at 50 Hz at the time-instants of the VFM measurements (for internal practical purposes); the stray field vectors are provided in the ASM sensor frame. ",
