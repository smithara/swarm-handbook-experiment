    "description": "Time series of field-aligned and radial current densities along the orbit using the dual-satellite method. Field-aligned current (FAC) density is derived by the multiplication of the radial current (IRC) density with the inclination angle of the geomagnetic field. The field-aligned current density can only be calculated at latitudes, where the magnetic field is well inclined, i.e. |I| > 30\u00b0. Near the magnetic equator for magnetic inclination angles |I| < 30\u00b0 FAC values are set to NaN. The radial current density can be provided along the whole orbit, except for latitudes \u03b8>86\u00b0 (near poles), where both FAC and IRC values are set to NaN. \n\nNote that the magnetic field data used for the dual-satellite method is low-pass filtered with a 3-dB cutoff period of 20 s (corresponding to a wavelength of 150 km). This step is indispensable because the lateral distance between Swarm A and Swarm C has to be taken into account.",
