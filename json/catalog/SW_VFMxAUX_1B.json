    "description": "The VFMXAUX_1B Product contains detailed information on the S/C magnetic stray fields and the Sun induced stray field (implemented from Product Baseline 04) at the VFM sensor position. The data are provided at 50 Hz at the time-instants of the VFM measurements; the stray field vectors are provided in the VFM sensor frame. ",
