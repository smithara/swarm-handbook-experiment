    "description": "The MAGX_LR_1B Product contains magnetic vector and scalar data at 1 Hz rate. The S/C data are processed to provide MAGX_LR_1B data at exact UTC seconds, i.e. both VFM vector and ASM scalar data are interpolated to yield these data. Hence, small gaps in the VFM or ASM data need not cause gaps in the product as the gaps may be filled by this interpolation. Any gaps, however, will have an impact on the error estimate of the associated product element. The measurement data set record of the MAGX_LR_1B Product is described in Table 3. See also Mag-L Data Set Record, MDR_MAG_LR.",
